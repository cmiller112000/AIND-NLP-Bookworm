    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a simple question-answering agent that is able to learn from any text data you provide, and answer queries posed in natural language. You will use IBM Watson's cloud-based services to process the input text data and find relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cloud-based NLP service instance and configure it.\n",
    "- Ingest a set of text documents using the service and analyze the results.\n",
    "- Accept questions in natural language and parse them.\n",
    "- Find relevant answers from the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Watson's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [IBM Bluemix platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to understand questions posed in natural language, we'll use another Watson service called [Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/index.html). It can be used to design conversational agents or _chatbots_ that exhibit complex behavior, but for the purpose of this project, we'll only use it to parse certain kinds of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Conversation service instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you did for the Discovery service, create an instance of the Conversation service. Then launch the associated tool from the service dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-tooling.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Tool homepage\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A _workspace_ allows you to keep all the items you need for a particular application in one place, just like an _environment_ in case of the Discovery service. Create one called \"Bookworm\" with a suitable description, such as \"I know a lot of stories. Ask me a question!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-workspace.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Blank workspace\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This should open up a blank workspace, where you can add intents, define the entities you want the agent to idenitfy and structure the overall dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add intents\n",
    "\n",
    "An _intent_ is the goal or purpose of a user's input. Create a set of intents (at least 3) that capture the different kinds of questions that you want the system to answer, e.g. _who_, _what_ and _where_. Along with each intent, add a list of user examples or _utterances_ that map to that intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could enter the following examples for the _where_ intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where is the Jedi temple located?\n",
    "- Where was Luke born?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conversation service recommends at least 5 examples for each intent so that Watson learns how to recognize it. These don't have to be very precise, but more examples the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-intents.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Intents listed\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to create your own intents, based on the kinds of questions you want the system to answer, e.g. \"How many ...\", \"What are the most common ...\" etc. Each intent will need to be mapped to an appropriate query.\n",
    "\n",
    "> See [**Defining intents**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/intents.html) for a helpful video and further instructions.\n",

    "**Q**: What intents did you add to the Conversation service instance?\n",

    "**A**:#Where\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Pick one of these intents, and list at least 5 examples for the intent that you entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "Where did Queen Amadala get an army from to fight the droids?\n",
    "Where did Luke Skywalker meet Leia?\n",
    "Where was Anakin Skywalker from?\n",
    "Where does Luke meet Yoda?\n",
    "Where does Han die?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add entities\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your intents set, let's tell the service what entities we want it to identify. One way to do this is using the tool interface, and entering them one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Go to [**Defining entities**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/entities.html) to see how that is done.\n",

    "## 5. Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Now that you have gone through this exercise of designing a system that uses two IBM Watson services, what did you learn? What were some of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "The Watson services are powerful services, especially the Discovery Service.  I find though, that it will take a lot of Watson specific learning to fully understand the questions you want to answer and how those questions sentence structure best mirrors how Watson Discovery service extracts out the various enriched text types, and how best to use them.  For instance, I took the original input sentence and made keywords out of any words not already covered by the entities or intent returns from the Conversation service.  This was done in an attempt to narrow down the best matches.  I would think if I myself better understood sentence structure, and how the Discovery service utilizes that, I could have developed better query options to do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was really impressed with the level of taxonomy and related concepts and links that Watson can find and make available.  There is a lot to learn here and how to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Optional) Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a set of sample data files containing Star Wars plot summaries. But as mentioned before, you are free to use your own dataset. In fact, a larger dataset maybe more suitable for use with IBM Watson's NLP services. If you used your own dataset, answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What dataset did you use, and in what ways is it different from the sample files provided?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: I used a Shakespeare History Plays as my dataset.  It was very different from typical english text of today,  Shakespearean prose and in script format.  While the discovery process seemed to find good entities and other extraction types, it wasn't very good at finding matches to my questions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Either include your dataset in the .zip file or repository you submit, or provide clear instructions on how to obtain the dataset, so that your reviewer can run your notebook or inspect the data to verify your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: \n",
    "I have included the 'shakepeare' folder in the zip file which contains an html set of files for each complete play in the 'history' set as found at this URL:\n",
    "http://shakespeare.mit.edu/works.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The submitted bookworm-shakespeare.ipynb and .html files contain the python code to process and query these files.  I did NOT re-answer the Q&A cells in that notebook, so they reflect my answers from this Star Wars oriented notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_You can also design a web-based application that utilizes these services and deploy that on Bluemix! If you do, please share with your instructors and peers._"
